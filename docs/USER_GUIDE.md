## 🚀 Getting Started

Access the application via your web browser at the deployed URL (or `http://localhost:3000` if running locally). The app is capable of working on both Desktop and Mobile devices, offering a responsive experience.

## 🔍 Searching for Buses

1.  **Home Page**: You will see a search interface upon loading the app.
2.  **Select Origin & Destination**:
    *   Tap the "From" field and select your starting point (e.g., *Puttur KSRTC*).
    *   Tap the "To" field and select your destination (e.g., *Mangalore Statebank*).
3.  **View Results**: The app will instantly display a list of buses matching your criteria.

> [!TIP]
> The app automatically filters out buses that have already departed, so you only see valid options for the current time.

## ⏱️ Understanding Live Status

The bus list cards provide real-time status updates to help you plan your journey. Look for these indicators:

| Status Indicator | Color | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Departing Now** | 🔴 **Pulsing Red** | The bus is leaving immediately. Hurry! |
| **Boarding** | 🟢 **Emerald** | The bus is at the platform and boarding has started. |
| **In X min** | 🔵 **Blue** | The bus is scheduled to arrive in X minutes. |
| **Scheduled** | ⚪ **Gray** | The bus is scheduled for a later time (more than 1 hour away). |

## 🗺️ Using the Live Map

The interactive map provides a visual representation of the bus routes.

*   **Route Visualization**: See the exact path the bus takes, including all stops and turns.
*   **Stops**: Tap on route markers to see stop names.
*   **Bus Position (Beta)**: Simulated bus icons move along the path based on estimated travel time.

## 🌐 Language Settings

PutturBus supports **English** and **Kannada**.
*   Look for the language switcher icon (usually in the top right or within the menu).
*   Toggle between languages to translate the interface and route names.
